How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to 
connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the 
future?
By using object oriented principles such as encapsulation and generalization, programs can be better written to suit a multitude of projects rather than only for an 
express purpose. The CRUD module developed exemplifies this as simply changing the database authentication information would allow the module to function with other 
MongoDB based databases.

How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your 
approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other 
client requests?
I often take a very analytical perspective when solving problems. My general approach to resolving the requirements requested by Grazioso Salvare did not differ greatly from my other courses as the same analytical approach I've used helps me find a solution quickly, although sometimes inefficiently. When I create databases in the future, ensuring that standard naming conventions are used for each data field and making the data value's type expressly or intuitively stated will help with the development of functionalities surrounding databases.

What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?
Computer scientists develop programs that assist in the organization of information, whether that is analyzing, protecting, storing, retrieving, modifying, or presenting 
data. As information is important for any company, the development of database functionalities made in this project would help companies more easily access relevant 
information and spend less time doing clerical work allowing more time to be spent in the field.
